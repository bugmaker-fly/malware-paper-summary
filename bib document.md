-  SMART, an automatic analysis framework, learns DSA by detecting and summarizing semantic clones from malware families, and then extracts semantic features from the learned DSA to classify malware according to the attack patterns.

## A multi-view context-aware approach to Android malware detection and malicious code localization

### 1. Paper Summary

- we propose MKLDROID, a unified framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localization
- MKLDROID uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information from apps’ dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view.

## Apk2vec: Semi-Supervised Multi-view Representation Learning for Profiling Android Applications

### 1. Paper Summary

- we design a semi-supervised Representation Learning (RL) framework named **apk2vec** to automatically generate a compact representation (aka profile/embedding) for a given app.
- it encompasses information from multiple semantic views such as API sequences, permissions, etc. 
- being a semi-supervised embedding technique, it can make use of labels associated with apps 
- it combines RL and feature hashing which allows it to efficiently build profiles of apps that stream over time

## Adaptive and scalable Android malware detection through online learning

### 1. Paper Summary

- In order to perform accurate detection, security-sensitive behavior are captured from apps in form of inter-procedural control-flow sub-graph features using a state-of-the-art graph kernel. 
- In order to perform scalable detection and to adapt to the drift and evolution in malware population, an online passive-aggressive classifier is used.

## Classification of Android apps and malware using deep neural networks

### 1. Paper Summary

- We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sequence classification and conduct a set of experiments on malware detection and categorization of software into functionality groups to test and compare our CNN with classifications by recurrent neural network (LSTM) and other n-gram based methods.
- Both CNN and LSTM significantly outperformed n-gram based methods.

## MaMaDroid: Detecting Android Malware by Building Markov Chains of Behavioral Models (Extended Version)

### 1. Paper Summary

- MAMADROID, an Android malware detection system that relies on app behavior, builds a   behavioral model, in the form of a Markov chain, from the sequence of abstracted API calls performed by an app, and uses it to extract features and perform classification.
- By abstracting calls to their packages or families, MAMADROID maintains resilience to API changes and keeps the feature set size manageable
