##  DroidNative: Automating and optimizing detection of Android native code malware variants 

### paper summary

- DroidNative, the first system that builds cross-platform semantic-based signatures at the Android native code level, can detect malware embedded in either bytecode or native code.
- Its detection rate is 93.57% and its false positive rate is 2.7%, which is better than other tools.

### Addition knowledge

- Symantec and F-Secure both are anti-virus software.

### Personal view

- I have seen this paper from another review paper, which affirms the achievements of this paper.

### Fact 

- green represents the current situation
- yellow means the disadvantages of current situation
- blue represents what we have done

## StubDroid: automatic inference of precise data-flow summaries for the android framework

### 1. Paper summary

- StubDroid, the first fully automated approach for inferring precise and efficient library models for taint-analysis problems.
- It can gain a high precise with less time and memory.

### 2. Addition knowledge

-  Smartphone users suffer from insufficient information on how commercial as well as malicious apps handle sensitive data stored on their phones. Automated taint analyses address this problem by allowing users to detect and investigate how applications access and handle this data. 
-  In most cases, the existence of those models is taken for granted, despite the fact that the models are hard to come by .

### 3. Personal view

- It is difficult for me to read this paper, because of a number of new words and long sentences.

## FlowDroid: precise context, flow, field, object-sensitive and lifecycle-aware taint analysis for Android apps

### 1. Paper summary

- FlowDroid, a novel and highly precise static taint analysis for Android applications.

- Novel on-demand algorithms help FlowDroid maintain high efficiency and precision at the same time.
- DroidBench, an open test suite for evaluating the effectiveness and accuracy of taint-analysis tools specification for Android apps.



# PScout: analyzing the Android permission specification

### 1. Paper summary

- perform an analysis of the permission system of the Android smartphone OS in an attempt to begin answering some of the questions about the permission system's design and implementation
- PScout, a tool that extracts the permission specification from Android OS source code using    static analysis and it has overcome several challenges.

### 2. Additional knowledge

- Permission system requires developers to declare what sensitive resources their applications will use, has users agree with this request when they install the application and constrains the application to the requested resources during runtime.  

  

##  Permission-Based Android Malware Detection 

### Paper summary

- a framework that can detect android malware applications is proposed to help organizing Android Market.
- It intends to develop a machine learning-based malware detection system on malware applications and to enhance security and privacy of smartphone users.
- This system monitors various permission-based features and events, and analyses these features by using machine learning to classify whether the application is malware or not.

##  An Android Application Sandbox System for Suspicious Software Detection 

### Paper summary

- Android Application Sandbox(AASandbox) is able to perform **both static and dynamic analysis** on Android programs to automatically detect suspicious applications.
-  Static analysis scans the software for malicious patterns without installing it. 
-  Dynamic analysis executes the application in a fully isolated environment.
- Both the sandbox and the detection algorithms can be deployed in the cloud, providing a fast and distributed detection of suspicious software in a mobile software store.

### Additional knowledge

- Android is based on Linux kernel.

### Personal view

- This paper is easy to understand and catches the important points well.

- It is worth to read completely.
