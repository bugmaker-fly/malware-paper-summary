## MobiDroid: A Performance-Sensitive Malware Detection System on Mobile Platform 

### 1. Paper summary

- an effective solution to detect malware on Android devices, is not perform on the server side .
- Android malware detection on the server side can not protect apps from unofficial markets and third-party resources but on Android devices can.

### 2. Additional knowledge

* Android malware detection on the server side is aimed at Android markets, which protect apps from the source of install.Personal views

### 3. Personal views

* the abstract of this paper wastes too many words on current situation and its shortage, which causes the introduction not detailed enough.

### 4. FACT

* green represents the current situation
* yellow means the disadvantages of current situation
* blue represents what we have done

##  Evaluation of Android Anti Malware Techniques against Dalvik Bytecode Obfuscation 

### 1. Paper sumary

- explore the resilience of anti-malware techniques against transformations for Android.
- evaluate resilience of Androguard's code similarity and AndroSimilar's robust statistical feature signature against code obfuscated malware.

### 2. Additional knowledge

- Dalvik bytecode: dalvik字节码就是smali或者（baijava）用编译产生的dalvik可执行文件

### 3. Personal views

- just from the abstract, I can not find the paper's innovation.

### 4. FACT

### 5. Attention

- if we need to read this paper more deeply, we are supposed to understand Dalvik bytecode clearly.
- I don't understand this paper indeed due to a number of professional concept, such as Dalvik bytecode, AndroSimilar.



##  Exfiltrating data from Android devices 

### 1. Paper summary

- propose an adversary(对手，敌手) model for Android covert data exfiltration, and demonstrate how it can be used to construct a mobile data exfiltration technique(MDET) to covertly exfiltrate data from Android devices.
-  two proof-of-concepts were implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of exfiltrating data via SMS and inaudible audio transmission using standard mobile devices 

### 2. Personal views

- I can't fingure out the usage of the follow sentence.  mentioned the interest of others, a constrast may be better.

##  Exploring reverse engineering symptoms in Android apps 

### 1. Paper summary

- AndroidSOO, a lightweight approach for the detection of repackaging symptoms on Android apps
- String Offset Order, the method is able to pinpoint symptoms fo reverse engineered Android apps without the need for complex further analysis.
- evaluation of String Order metric to assess its capabilities on datasets.
- performed a large-scale study of over 5000 Android applications and over 80000 samples.

### 2. Additional knowledge

- makware authors can plagiareze Android applications(e.g., though code reuse and repackaging), which can boost the amount of malware on the markets.

### 3. Personal views

- from my perspective, this abstract performs good enough.



## AppSpear: Bytecode Decrypting and DEX Reassembling for Packed Android Malware

### 1. Paper summary

- a systematic study on existing Android malware which is  packed
- a thorough investigation on many Android malware samples is conducted to take statistics of how widespread are those samples protected by Android packers
- AppSpear, a better system for antomatically malware unpacking.
-  Its core technique is a bytecode decrypting and Dalvik executable (DEX) reassembling method 

### 2. Additional knowledge

- Android packer is a way to pack apps to apk.\
- as to an effective Android malware detection, taking the unpacking issue into consideration is necessary to prove the accurary.

### 3. Personal views

the length of paper abstract is too long.

### 4.Attention

- what is Android packers? I don't know it clearly.



 ## Inferring the Detection Logic and Evaluating the Effectiveness of Android Anti-Virus Apps  

### 1. Paper summary

- Inferring the Detection Logic: to determine the key elements used by the AVs through a black-box testing methodology.
-  experiments show that a majority of AVs detect malware using simple static features, which  can be easily obfuscated by renaming or encrypting strings and data.

### 2. Additional knowledge

- most anti-virus apps are presented as black-boxes without details given about their working.

### 3. Personal views

- without current research situation.



##  Reviving Android Malware with DroidRide: And How Not To 

### 1. Paper summary

- submit a framework, DroidRide, which can make Android malware less catchable to detectors and more active on phones.
- from a opposite perspective, it can test malware detectors good or not.
- nowadays, a great number of malwares can evade detectoes, especially in signature-based detectors.

### 2. Addition knowledge

- even known malicious apps can evade quiet a few detectors.

### 3. Personal views

- I think that it could be better we propose the achievement, DroidRide first.
- the abstract doesn't show its innocation.

### 4. FACT

##  Repackman: a tool for automatic repackaging of Android apps   

### 1. Paper summary

- Repackman, a tool to automatically repackage Android apps with arbitraruy payloads.
- to save the problem that releasing and evaluating anti-repackaging techniques is hindered by the difficulty of acqurering repackaged versions of legitimate apps.

### 2. Addition knowledge

-  Repackaging is a technique adopted by attackers to generate fake, malicious versions of legitimate Android apps, which undermines users’ trust in the Android ecosystem. 

### 3. Personal views

- The background introduction is very detailed.
